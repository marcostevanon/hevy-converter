Fitbod supports multiplier so you can store the weight of some exercises (e.g. dumbbell exercises) for just one arm and the multiplier values ​​tell you whether to multiply to get the total weight

TODO
- add an alert explaining this and how to proceed with import in Hevy
  - Do you want total weight in the set row or just considering one arm (show some illustrations maybe)
